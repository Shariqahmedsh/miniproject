There are so many things which I can share about the prestigious institute where I thrived my four years of life. It was such an incredible experience. I can tell alot about the events which take place there, the expert lectures, the amazing seminars, the innovative projects based on technology, inspite of all these things the greatest and most important asset KNSIT has is the their lectures. I would prefer to call them as my teachers and mentors of life instead of just saying as lectures because the teachers which I had their were one of the best supporters and motivators I have ever met in my life. I always pray a very well future for my college and my great teachers. May Allah bless you all.
